## TODO:

- Checkout asio timer problem (see code below)
- Check path validity when creating branches and terminals
- Whether or not a branch is actively receiving broadcasts must be conveyed when connecting to other branches in one of the initial messages to avoid missing broadcasts
- Add connection statistics (msg/sec, bytes/sec, etc.)
- Remote bytes_written/bytes_read from Transport::SendAll/ReceiveAll?
- Need to check user data size. Right now, an assertion triggers when it's too large.
- Would it make sense to have a user-defined function that gets called in case that a buffer is too small? That function could then increase the buffer size and have the data re-copied. This would probably have to be a per-API call parameter though...
- In yogi-cpp: In some classes (e.g. BranchInfo, Branch) there are getters called GetSomething() whereas in other classes (e.g. PayloadView) the getters are called Something(). Should this be consistent?

Use those CMakeLists.txt defines for compilers:
IF ("${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}" STREQUAL "GNU")
         SET (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++17 ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")
ELSEIF ("${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}" STREQUAL "Clang")
         SET (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++17 ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")
ELSEIF ("\${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}" STREQUAL "MSVC")
MESSAGE ( FATAL_ERROR "MSVC doesn't support C++17.")
ENDIF ()

Outgoing data queue design:

- Needs size limit, otherwise it could potentially grow to GBs if the user does something dumb
- Could block send() if queue is full. That's fine if context.run() is running in a background thread.
- Give send() function an option to block or fail when queue is full. If context.run() is not running in background thread user might be screwed if blocking is set.

Interface Description:

"name": "Engine",
"description": "Interface for controlling and monitoring the engine",
"terminals": [
{
"path": "RPM",
"type": "Publish",
"description": "Rounds Per Minute",
"data": [
{
"type": "float",
"description": "Rounds per minute with 0.1 RPM accuracy",
"min": 0,
"max": 5000
}

Terminal types:

- Constant - Constant
- Publisher - Subscriber
- Requester - Responder / Surveyor - Surveyee
- Pair - Pair
- Semaphore - Lock

- File - File
- Video - Video
- Audio - Audio

=> Should a subscriber be able to connect to a constant?
This makes sense because if the receiver expects something that is not const
then it doesn't mind if it is in fact const.

=> Should a publisher or subscriber be able to connect to a pair (one way comms)?
Tricky because the semantics of a pair are "only connect with one other".

Every terminal is either tagged as provider or consumer. A process offering
an interface uses only provider terminals while processes using an interface
uses only consumer terminals. While provider terminals have paths (names)
describing where in their owning branch they appear, consumer terminals have
paths to the remote branch that they should be connected to. Consumer terminals
only ever connect to provider terminals; it's never the other way around. A
consumer terminal can be connected to at most a single provider terminal while
provider terminals can be connected to an arbitrary number of consumer terminals
if the terminal type supports it (e.g. Pair terminals only support a single
connection).
