//!   ...
//! \endcode
//!
//! These variables can then be used anywhere in the configuration, even in the
//! *variables* section itself as shown above.
//!
//! \note
//!   Even if the value of a variable is not a string, the placeholder *${name}*
//!   always has to be a string to conform to the JSON format. When resolving a

//!   be changed accordingly if and only if the placeholder is surrounded by

 * Creates a new branch.
 *
 * A branch represents an entry point into a Yogi network. It advertises itself

 * it connects to them via TCP to retrieve further information such as their
 * name, description and network name. If the network names match, two branches
 * attempt to authenticate with each other by securely comparing passwords.
 * Once authentication succeeds and there is no other known branch with the same
 * path then the branches can actively communicate as part of the Yogi network.
 *
 * The branch is configured via the \p props parameter. The supplied JSON must
 * have the following structure:
 *
 * \code
 *   {
 *     "name":                 "Fan Controller",
 *     "description":          "Controls a fan via PWM",
 *     "path":                 "/Cooling System/Fan Controller",

 *     "timeout":              3.0,
 *     "ghost_mode":           false
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * All of the properties are optional and if unspecified (or set to _null_),
 * their respective default values will be used (see \ref CV). The properties
 * have the following meaning:
 *  - __name__: Name of the branch (default: PID\@hostname without the
 *    backslash).
 *  - __description__: Description of the branch.
 *  - __path__: Path of the branch in the network (default: /name where name is
 *    the name of the branch). Must start with a slash.
 *  - __network_name__: Name of the network to join (default: the machine's
 *    hostname).
 *  - __network_password__: Password for the network (default: no password)
 *  - __advertising_address__: Multicast address to use for advertising, e.g.
 *    239.255.0.1 for IPv4 or ff31::8000:1234 for IPv6.
 *  - __advertising_port__: Port to use for advertising.
 *  - __advertising_interval__: Time between advertising messages. Must be at
 *    least 1 ms.
 *  - __ghost_mode__: Set to true to activate ghost mode (default: false).
 *
 * Advertising and establishing connections can be limited to certain network
 * interfaces via the _interface_ property. The default is to use all
 * available interfaces.
 *
 * Setting the _ghost_mode_ property to _true_ prevents the branch from actively
 * participating in the Yogi network, i.e. the branch will not advertise itself
 * and it will not authenticate in order to join a network. However, the branch
 * will temporarily connect to other branches in order to obtain more detailed
 * information such as name, description, network name and so on. This is useful
 * for obtaining information about active branches without actually becoming
 * part of the Yogi network.

/*!
 * Creates a new terminal.
 *
 * Terminals are the communication endpoints in Yogi. Each terminal is
 * associated with exactly one branch and each branch can have an arbitrary
 * number of terminals. Terminals are uniquely identified by their UUID as well
 * as by the combination their path and the branch they belong to.
 *
 * Upon creation, a terminal is either a *prividing* or a *consuming* terminal.
 * Providing terminals have paths (names) that describe where in the owning
 * branch they are located. Consuming terminals have paths that describe where
 * in the network their providing terminal resides. This means that a connection
 * between terminals is always initiated from the consuming terminal; i.e. only
 * the consuming terminal needs to know the location of their connected
 * counterpart.
 *
 * Each terminal is of one of the following types:
 *  - __Variable__: A single providing _Variable_ "owns" the variable. The value
 *    of the variable is the message that has last been sent over the provider
 *    or received by the provider from any of the consuming _Variable_
 *    terminals. Once the value of the variable changes, the provider sends
 *    the new value to all consumers. The value gets cached such that new
 *    consumers will receive the current value of the variable. Compatible
 *    types: _Variable_ (provider/consumer) and _ReadOnlyVariable_ (consumer).
 *  - __ReadOnlyVariable__: Same as _Variable_ but consumers cannot change the
 *    value of the variable. Compatible types: _ReadOnlyVariable_
 *    (provider/consumer), _Variable_ (provider), and _Constant_ (provider).
 *  - __WriteOnlyVariable__: Same as _Variable_ but consumers cannot read the
 *    value of the variable. Compatible types: _WriteOnlyVariable_
 *    (provider/consumer), _Variable_ (provider).
 *  - __Constant__: Same as _ReadOnlyVariable_ but the state of the variable
 *    never changes after it has initially been set. Compatible types:
 *    _Constant_ (provider/consumer) and _ReadOnlyVariable_ (consumer).
 *  - __Publisher__: Publishes messages to an arbitrary number of _Subscriber_
 *    terminals. Compatible types: _Subscriber_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Subscriber__: Receives messages published by _Publisher_ terminals.
 *    Compatible types: _Publisher_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Surveyor__: Sends a request message to an arbitrary number of
 *    _Surveyee_ terminals that in turn answer with a response message.
 *    Compatible types: _Surveyee_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Surveyee__: Answers messages from _Surveyor_ terminals by sending a
 *    response message for each received request. Compatible types:
 *    _Surveyor_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Pair__: Allows messaging between exactly one providing and one consuming
 *    _Pair_ terminal. Compatible types: _Pair_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Semaphore__: Can be acquired via _Lock_ terminals a configured number of
 *    N times simultaneously. Compatible types: _Lock_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Mutex__: Special case of a _Semaphore_ where N = 1, i.e. it can only be
 *    acquired by a single _Lock_ terminal at a time. Compatible types:
 *    _Lock_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Lock__: Acquires _Semaphore_ and _Mutex_ terminals. Compatible types:
 *    _Semaphore_ (provider/consumer) and _Mutex_ (provider/consumer).
 *  - __Stream__: Allows streaming of data, e.g. for video or audio data. The
 *    provider represents the source and the consumer represents of an arbitrary
 *    number of sinks of the stream. Compatible types: _Stream_
 *    (provider/consumer).
 *  - __File__: Allows transferring files. The provider supplies the file to an
 *    arbitrary number of consumers. Compatible types: _File_
 *    (provider/consumer).
 *
 * The terminal's properties are configured via the \p props parameter. The
 * supplied JSON must have the following structure:
 *
 * \code
 *   {
 *     "path":        "Temperature",
 *     "type":        "Variable",
 *     "role":        "Provider",
 *     "description": "The engine's temperature",
 *     "data": [
 *       {
 *         "type":        "float",
 *         "description": "Temperature in degrees Celsius",
 *         "min":         -50,
 *         "max":         300
 *       }, {
 *         "type":        "int",
 *         "description": "Timestamp"
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The properties have the following meaning:
 *  - __path__ (optional): Path of the terminal (prefixed by \p pathpfx).
 *  - __type__: Type of the terminal (see above for possible types).
 *  - __role__ (optional): Role of the terminal.
 *  - __description__ (optional): Additional information about the terminal.
 *  - __data__: Schema for the data type that is transmitted.
 *
 * \note
 *   The final path of the terminal will be determined by joining the \p pathpfx
 *   and the value of the _path_ string from the JSON above. At most one of
 *   these two may be empty or NULL.
 *
 * \param[out] terminal Pointer to the terminal handle
 * \param[in]  branch   The branch to use
 * \param[in]  pathpfx  Path prefix of the terminal (can be NULL)
 * \param[in]  rolesrc  Provider-consumer role source (see \ref RLS)
 * \param[in]  props    Terminal properties as JSON
 * \param[in]  section  Section in \p props to use (NULL means the root
 *                      section; syntax is JSON pointer (RFC 6901))
 *
 * \returns [=0] #YOGI_OK if successful
 * \returns [<0] An error code in case of a failure (see \ref EC)
