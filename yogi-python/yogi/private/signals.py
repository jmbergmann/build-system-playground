    Signals in Yogi are intended to be used similarly to POSIX signals. They
    have to be raised explicitly by the user (e.g. when receiving an actual
    POSIX signal like SIGINT) via this function. A signal will be received by
    all signal sets containing that signal.

    The sigarg parameter can be used to deliver user-defined data to the
    signal handlers.

    The cleanup handler fn will be called once all signal handlers have been
    called. Once fn has been called, the sigarg parameter is not used any more
    and can be cleaned up.

    Note: The cleanup handler fn can get called either from within the
          raise_signal() function or from any context within the program.

    Args:
        signal: The signal to raise (must be a single signal).
        sigarg: User-defined data to pass to the signal handlers.
