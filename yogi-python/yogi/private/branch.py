    A branch represents an entry point into a YOGI network. It advertises

    required for establishing a connection. If a branch detects other branches
    on the network, it connects to them via TCP to retrieve further
    information such as their name, description and network name. If the
    network names match, two branches attempt to authenticate with each other
    by securely comparing passwords. Once authentication succeeds and there is
    no other known branch with the same path then the branches can actively
    communicate as part of the Yogi network.

              "rx_queue_size":          100000
            }

        All of the properties are optional and if unspecified (or set to
        null), their respective default values will be used. The properties
        have the following meaning:
         - name: Name of the branch (default: PID@hostname).
         - description: Description of the branch.
         - path: Path of the branch in the network (default: /name where name
           is the name of the branch). Must start with a slash.
         - network_name: Name of the network to join (default: the machine's
           hostname).
         - network_password: Password for the network (default: no password).
         - advertising_interfaces: Network interfaces to use for advertising
           and for branch connections. Valid strings are Unix device names
           ("eth0", "en5", "wlan0"), adapter names on Windows ("Ethernet",
           "VMware Network Adapter WMnet1") or MAC addresses
           ("11:22:33:44:55:66"). Furthermore, the special strings "localhost"
           and "all" can be used to denote loopback and all available
           interfaces respectively.
         - advertising_address: Multicast address to use for advertising, e.g.
           239.255.0.1 for IPv4 or ff02::8000:1234 for IPv6.
         - advertising_port: Port to use for advertising.
         - advertising_interval: Time between advertising messages. Must be at
           least 1 ms.
         - ghost_mode: Set to true to activate ghost mode (default: false).
         - tx_queue_size: Size of the send queues for remote branches.
         - rx_queue_size: Size of the receive queues for remote branches.

        Advertising and establishing connections can be limited to certain
        network interfaces via the _interface_ property. The default is to use
        all available interfaces.

        Setting the ghost_mode property to true prevents the branch from
        actively participating in the Yogi network, i.e. the branch will not
        advertise itself and it will not authenticate in order to join a
        network. However, the branch will temporarily connect to other
        branches in order to obtain more detailed information such as name,
        description, network name and so on. This is useful for obtaining
        information about active branches without actually becoming part of
        the Yogi network.

        Attention:
          The _tx_queue_size_ and _rx_queue_size_ properties affect every
          branch connection and can therefore consume a large amount of memory.
          For example, in a network of 10 branches where these properties are
          set to 1 MB, the resulting memory used for the queues would be
          10 x 2 x 1 MB = 20 MB for each of the 10 branches. This value grows
          with the number of branches squared.

        Args:
            context: The context to use.
            props:   Branch properties as JSON.
            section: Section in props to use instead of the root section.
                     Syntax is JSON pointer (RFC 6901).
