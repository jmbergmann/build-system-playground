    This function supports colourizing the output if the terminal that the
    process is running in supports it. The color used for a log entry depends
    on the entry's severity. For example, errors will be printed in red and
    warnings in yellow.

    Each log entry contains the *component* tag which describes which part of
    a program issued the log entry. For entries created by the library itself,
    this parameter is prefixed with the string "Yogi.", followed by the
    internal component name. For example, the component tag for a branch would
    be "Yogi.Branch".

    timestamp. The following placeholders are supported:
        %Y: Four digit year.

        %9: Nanoseconds as decimal number 000 to 999.
